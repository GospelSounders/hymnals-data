## Hymnals-Data
This is intended to provide the most comprehensive database of the hymnals (and songs) ever used by Advent Believers since [the Great Religious Awakening.](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Great_Controversy_(White)/A_Great_ReligiousAwakening)

## Components
Hymnals Data works together with these other components:

  - [Study Hymnal](https://github.com/GospelSounders/all-sda-hymnals)
  - [Update hymnals](https://github.com/GospelSounders/updatehymnals)
  - [All Hymnals](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16-cSCawG9fX__QXLWnPyC9-tBUDW2lW7lLhm5UfpEtI/edit?usp=sharing)


Hymnals Data is the readily usable database for hymns used by advent believers. Input is made in [All Hymnals Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16-cSCawG9fX__QXLWnPyC9-tBUDW2lW7lLhm5UfpEtI/edit?usp=sharing) from which it is forwarded by [Update hymnals](https://github.com/GospelSounders/updatehymnals) to dev branch of this repo. After proofreading the contents in dev are marged with master. Then they can be picked from master by [Study Hymnal](https://github.com/GospelSounders/all-sda-hymnals) for use by anyone and everyone.

## Creating And Updating Hymnals

This is a brief explanation of how to edit hymns and hymnals.

Goto [All Hymnals Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16-cSCawG9fX__QXLWnPyC9-tBUDW2lW7lLhm5UfpEtI/edit?usp=sharing) 

It is almost self explanatory after that. We will add more instructions here in due course
